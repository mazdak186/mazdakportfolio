Born and raised in Chicago, I have always had an interest in problem solving with technology. 
I grew up tinkering with a personal computer my parents had given me which led to a life-long curiosity of trying to understand how these seemingly magical systems functioned. 
Thanks to an inspirational high school honors physics teacher, I began by taking computer science and video game design courses in highschool which had led me to completing my Bachelor's degree in Engineering. 
Throughout my rich and varied experiences, I have laid out my educational framework to begin my career as a hardworking industrial engineer with a passion for developing machine learning and data science solutions. 
I am currently seeking a position that utilizes my knowledge and creativity to design customer-driven solutions for industry challenges.
